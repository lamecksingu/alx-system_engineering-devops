Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:

Duration: The outage occurred on May 10, 2024, from 3:00 PM to 5:30 PM (UTC).
Impact: The outage affected the authentication service, resulting in users experiencing login failures and inability to access secured areas of the website. Approximately 30% of users were affected during the outage.
Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the authentication service database, leading to a sudden surge in authentication requests, overwhelming the system's capacity.

Timeline:

3:00 PM: The issue was detected when monitoring alerts indicated a spike in authentication failures.
3:05 PM: Engineers noticed a significant increase in error logs related to database queries.
3:10 PM: Initial investigation focused on network connectivity and server health checks, assuming a potential server overload issue.
3:30 PM: Further analysis revealed no abnormal network traffic or server performance issues, leading to suspicion of a database-related issue.
4:00 PM: Escalation to the database administration team for deeper analysis.
4:30 PM: Database administrators identified a misconfigured index causing inefficient query execution.
5:00 PM: Temporary workaround implemented to alleviate database load and restore service availability.
5:30 PM: Permanent fix applied by adjusting database index configuration.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause Explanation: The misconfigured index on the authentication service database caused inefficient query execution, leading to a bottleneck in the authentication process.
Resolution: The issue was resolved by reconfiguring the database index to optimize query performance and prevent future bottlenecks.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Implement regular database performance audits to identify and address potential bottlenecks proactively.
Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect abnormal query patterns and database workload.
Establish automated alerts for critical database performance metrics to facilitate early detection of issues.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Conduct a thorough review of database configurations to identify and rectify any other potential performance bottlenecks.
Develop and implement a robust database configuration management process to prevent future misconfigurations.
Enhance documentation and knowledge sharing among teams to ensure prompt resolution of similar incidents in the future.
