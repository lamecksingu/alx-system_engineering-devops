Specifics:
Additional Elements Explanation:

Server 2 is added as a replica to distribute the load and provide high availability.
HAproxy is added to distribute traffic and ensure that the application servers share the load effectively.

Load Balancer Configuration:

The load balancer uses a round-robin distribution algorithm by default.
It evenly distributes incoming requests among the available application servers.

Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Setup:

The setup is Active-Active because both application servers (Server 1 and Server 2) are actively serving traffic.
Active-Passive would mean that only one server actively serves traffic while the other is in standby.

Database Primary-Replica Cluster:

In a Primary-Replica cluster, the Primary node handles read and write operations, while the Replica handles read-only operations.
This setup improves performance and provides fault tolerance in case the Primary node fails.

Difference Between Primary and Replica for the Application:

The application connects to the Primary node for read and write operations.
In case of a failure or maintenance, the application can connect to the Replica for read-only operations, ensuring continuous service.

Issues with this Infrastructure:

Single Points of Failure (SPOF):

The load balancer itself can become a single point of failure. We can consider adding redundancy or a secondary load balancer for high availability.
Security Issues:

Lack of firewall configurations and absence of HTTPS can expose the infrastructure to security threats.
We can implement firewalls and enable HTTPS to enhance security.
No Monitoring:

Without monitoring, it's challenging to identify issues, performance bottlenecks, or potential failures.
We can implement monitoring tools to track the health and performance of servers, load balancer, and the database.
