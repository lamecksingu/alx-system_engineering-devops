Additional Elements Explanation:

Load balancing with HAproxy is added to distribute incoming traffic across the web and application servers.
The use of separate servers for web, application, and database components allows for better resource allocation, scalability, and maintenance.

Load Balancer Purpose:

Load balancing ensures even distribution of incoming traffic, preventing overload on any single server.
It improves performance, scalability, and provides fault tolerance by distributing the load among multiple servers.

Server Split Components:

Separating components onto dedicated servers allows for better resource management and scalability.
Isolating components enhances security and simplifies maintenance tasks.
