Specifics:
Additional Elements Explanation:

Firewalls are added to control and secure incoming and outgoing traffic, limiting potential threats.
SSL termination at the load balancer ensures encrypted communication between users and the infrastructure.
Monitoring clients collect data for performance analysis, error tracking, and infrastructure health monitoring.

Firewalls Purpose:

Firewalls control access to and from servers, preventing unauthorized access and enhancing security.

Traffic Served over HTTPS:

HTTPS encrypts data in transit, providing confidentiality and integrity, and authenticating the server.

Monitoring Purpose:

Monitoring is used to track the health and performance of servers, identify issues, and analyze usage patterns.

How Monitoring Tool Collects Data:

Monitoring clients on each server collect data on resource usage, errors, and performance metrics.
The monitoring tool aggregates this data for centralized analysis and reporting.

Monitoring Web Server QPS:

To monitor web server Queries Per Second (QPS), set up monitoring for incoming requests and track the server's responsiveness.

Issues with this Infrastructure:
SSL Termination at the Load Balancer:

If SSL termination happens at the load balancer, the communication between the load balancer and backend servers is unencrypted.
To address this, use end-to-end encryption by configuring SSL on both the load balancer and backend servers.

Single MySQL Server Accepting Writes:

Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes can be a single point of failure.
Consider configuring a MySQL Primary-Replica cluster to distribute the load and ensure fault tolerance.

Uniform Server Components:

Uniform server components across servers might be a problem if there's a common vulnerability affecting all components.
Periodically update and patch server components to address potential security vulnerabilities.
